This is an exercise to test the commit function of GitHub. More soon.
Pondering documentation as I continue to learn about the functionality of GitHub. After getting my feet wet a bit I don't think this is going to be as useful for the production of my dissertation as I thought, mostly because I'm so used to the WYSIWYG presentation of Word and its analogs, and I don't know how to convert from this text (code?) to a Word doc. What I want is a more document-friendly (though not OpenDocument, I don't think) version of GitHubâ€”one that doesn't make me cross genres this much, even though the benefits of crossing genres are at the heart of my dissertation project.
I don't even know how to make a proper paragraph here.
What I wrote in bed earlier in SimpleNote:
>> [supposed to be indenting for a block-quote?]
How do you produce a book-length project with the WYSIWYG presentation of Word, the version-control and collaborative functions (and task management) of GitHub, the task-management and idea-boarding of Trello, and the bells and whistles of Scrivener?
>> [I don't think this is indenting for a block-quote because it's underlining]
I'm hoping maybe I'll find some folks on here who might want to collaborate on making that: a "digital-humanities" tool that might actually be useful (sorry not sorry for the snark).
In the meantime, I can play around with documenting the whys of my dissertation, which I read somewhere is part of the open-source ethos.

Am I right?
